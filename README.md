# 🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project utilizes **machine learning** to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms. It employs multiple classification models to determine the most likely disease.

## 🔹 Key Features

✔️ **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Feature selection for improved model performance

✔️ **Model Training**
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

✔️ **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- ROC Curve & AUC Score

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development & Analysis)
